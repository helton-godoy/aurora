        "description": "This task involves implementing a comprehensive validation system to ensure all server interactions with MCP task-master-ai meet the required standards, including data consistency and security checks.",
        "details": "To implement the complete server validation, we will need to design and integrate a robust validation layer that encompasses various aspects of server functionality. This includes but is not limited to: verifying data formats, validating user input, checking for potential SQL injection vulnerabilities, ensuring data encryption, and implementing appropriate logging mechanisms. The system will require a combination of server-side scripting (e.g., Node.js) and database-level checks to ensure data integrity. We will also need to consider scalability and performance implications of the new validation layer as it integrates with existing infrastructure. Additionally, we must develop comprehensive test cases that cover both positive and negative scenarios to verify the correct implementation and functionality of this feature.",
        "testStrategy": "To thoroughly test the complete server validation system, we will use a multi-step approach: first, we'll validate individual components (e.g., data formats, user input) in isolation using unit tests. Next, we'll conduct integration tests that simulate real-world scenarios to ensure seamless interaction between different modules. Finally, we'll execute a comprehensive set of end-to-end tests to verify the entire system works as expected, including edge cases and error handling. Throughout testing, we will use tools like Postman or cURL to simulate server interactions and leverage existing test frameworks (e.g., Jest) for faster development and more efficient testing.",
