			"complexityScore": 8,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 0,
			"expansionPrompt": "Expand upon existing infrastructure to implement comprehensive server validation system.",
			"reasoning": "High complexity score due to the need to integrate various aspects of server functionality, including data consistency and security checks. Additionally, the implementation requires a combination of server-side scripting and database-level checks, which adds to the overall complexity."

			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down design into smaller subtasks: (1) Identify validation layer components, (2) Develop detailed architecture documentation, (3) Define interfaces and interactions with existing infrastructure, (4) Create data flow diagrams.",
			"reasoning": "Moderate complexity score due to the need to develop a comprehensive design document outlining the validation layer's architecture. However, the number of recommended subtasks is higher due to the complexity of the task."
